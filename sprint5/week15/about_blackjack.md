## Objective
The goal of Blackjack is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player competes against the dealer. If the player’s hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand, the player wins. If the dealer goes over 21 (busts), the player wins. If the player goes over 21 (busts), they lose.

## Card Values
- **Ace (A)**: Can be worth 1 or 11, whichever is more favorable to the player.
- **2-10**: Face value (2 is worth 2 points, 3 is worth 3 points, etc.).
- **Face Cards (J, Q, K)**: Worth 10 points.

## The Game
1. **Deal**: The dealer gives two cards to the player and themselves. The player’s cards are face-up, and the dealer’s cards are one face-up and one face-down (the "hole" card).
2. **Player's Turn**: The player can choose to:
   - **Hit**: Take another card.
   - **Stand**: Keep their current hand.
   - ~~**Double Down**: Double the bet and receive exactly one more card.~~
   - ~~**Split**: If the player’s first two cards are of the same value, they can split them into two separate hands, each with its own bet.~~
3. **Dealer's Turn**: After the player has finished, the dealer reveals their hole card. The dealer must hit until their hand totals 17 or higher.
4. **Winning**: The player wins if their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's or if the dealer busts. The player loses if they bust or have a lower hand value than the dealer.

## Example of Play
1. The player is dealt a 10 of Spades and a 6 of Hearts (total: 16).
2. The dealer has a King of Clubs face-up and a 5 of Diamonds face-down (total: 15).
3. The player decides to **Hit** and gets a 5 of Spades, making their total 21.
4. The dealer reveals their hole card and must draw until reaching 17. The dealer draws a 7, making their total 22, which is a bust.
5. The player wins because the dealer busts.

## Tips
- If you have a hand total of 12-16, consider the dealer's card to decide whether to hit or stand. If the dealer’s face-up card is weak (2-6), you may want to stand to force the dealer to bust.
- Always stand if you have a hand total of 17 or higher, unless you're playing with multiple decks and have strategies for card counting.

Good luck, and may the odds be in your favor!
