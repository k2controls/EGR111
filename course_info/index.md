# EGR 111 - Introduction to Computer Science (C Language)

### [EGR111](../) - Course Information

Welcome to Introduction to Computer Science using the C Language (EGR111). This initial computer science course provided by NMC is designed to be a first step in becoming a software developer. The course experience is also an opportunity for others to investigate the process of writing code. 

The goal of the course is to teach you the fundamentals of coding while also using industry standard patterns and practices. Yes, you'll write solution coding in the C programming language, but we'll also work to understand general concepts of software development and how the specifics of the C language relate. Coding in C is difficult related to other scripting languages such as Python and Ruby, but as an intermediate language it provides crucial concepts and capabilities that are core to becoming a professional software or hardware engineer.
