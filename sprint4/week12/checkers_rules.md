### Checkers game rules:

- **Board Setup**: The game is played on an 8x8 board with alternating dark and light squares. Each player starts with 12 pieces placed on the dark squares of the three rows closest to them.
- **Objective**: The goal is to capture all of the opponent’s pieces or block them so they cannot make a move.
- **Movement**: 
  - Pieces move diagonally forward on the board, one square at a time, on dark squares only.
  - Regular pieces can only move forward.
- **Jumping (Capturing)**: 
  - A piece can "jump" over an adjacent opponent’s piece if the square immediately beyond it is empty.
  - Jumped pieces are removed from the board.
  - Multiple jumps can be made in a single turn if the conditions are met (i.e., each jump is over an opponent's piece with an empty square immediately after it).
  - **Jumping is a required move**: If a jump is available, it must be made. If multiple jumps are available, the player must make the jump that captures the most pieces.
- **Kinging**: 
  - When a piece reaches the last row on the opponent’s side of the board, it is "kinged" and placed on top of the original piece.
  - Kings can move both forward and backward diagonally.
- **Turns**: Players alternate turns, with each turn consisting of moving one piece.
- **Winning**: The game is won when a player captures all of the opponent’s pieces or blocks the opponent from making any legal moves.
- **Draw**: A draw can occur if neither player can make progress in capturing the opponent's pieces.
